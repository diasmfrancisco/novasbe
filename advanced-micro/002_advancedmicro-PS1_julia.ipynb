    "(f) Suppose a secretary of the market announces that all trading must take place at $P_X = €1$ and $P_Y = €2$. Furthermore, the secretary takes away each person’s initial endowment and replaces it with its cash value. The secretary instructs each person to order the quantities of $X$ and $Y$ that maximize utility subject to the budget constraint.\n",

    "2. Can the secretary fill these orders with the endowments collected? Go through the same exercise with $P_X=€2$ and explain why the outcome is feasible and efficient.\n"
